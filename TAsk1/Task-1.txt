Welcome to the world of k-Nearest Neighbors! It's a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

At its core, k-NN makes predictions based on the average of the k-nearest data points. But how do we determine k?

The value of k is determined using distances. Distance metrics such as Euclidean, Manhattan, or Minkowski play a crucial role here.

First of all, let's talk about Euclidean distance. It's like the straight-line distance between two points in space.

Next, we have Manhattan distance. It's the sum of absolute differences between the coordinates of two points.

Lastly, there's Minkowski distance, which combines both Euclidean and Manhattan distances into one flexible formula

this all are the formulaes of distances.

k-NN doesn't require a training phase. By using distance metrics directly on the input data, k-NN can make immediate predictions without the need for model fitting.

Different distance metrics have different properties, making them more suitable for specific types of data or applications. They provide robustness against noisy data or outliers, ensuring the reliability of k-NN predictions

In summary, k-NN leverages distance metrics to make accurate predictions in classification and regression tasks. Its simplicity, combined with the power of distance, makes it a valuable tool in the world of machine learning
